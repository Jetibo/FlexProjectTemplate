Time to complete: _~8 minutes_

:::info INFO

These steps require Flex UI version 2.x to be configured on your Flex account.

:::

1. [Create your own repository](https://github.com/twilio-professional-services/flex-project-template/generate) using the template.
   - (Optional) After creating your repo, you may also want to [attach the history to your new repository](/building/merge-future-updates) to be able to later pull in future updates--this can also be done later.
   
   - _NOTE_ If you are on the free GitHub tier, the repository will need to be public. If you are on the free tier and still want to use a private repo you will need to clone the deploy script to have dedicated secrets per environment
2. [Create a Twilio API key and secret](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-an-api-key#how-can-i-create-api-keys) for your account, which we will use in the next step.
3. In GitHub, navigate to the repository you created in step 1, click the Settings tab -> Environments -> "New Environment"
   - For the environment name, do not include spaces or other special characters except hyphens and underscores
   - Add the following secrets for that environment:
     - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - the account sid you want to deploy to
     - `TWILIO_API_KEY` - the api key or key "sid" as its otherwise known
     - `TWILIO_API_SECRET` - the api secret
     - `TF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` this can be any string value you want
   - your environment secrets should look something like this (TF_ENCRYPTION_KEY can be a repo or environment secret)

4. Log in to Flex, open the admin panel, and validate Flex UI 2.x is the configured version.
5. _Optionally_ navigate to the Flex console and enable the [Flex dialpad](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/flex/manage/voice?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fflex%2Fvoice%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1) (this is required for some features)
6. Navigate over to GitHub actions of your repository and select the `Deploy Flex` action script, _select the environment_ you want to deploy, and check the boxes for
   - `Is this the first release to the environment?`
   - `Deploy Terraform?`  (as *cautioned* below)

:::danger Important!
These deploy steps will set up TaskRouter and Studio configuration to allow more complex features to work out-of-the-box. The following resources will be completely replaced and overwritten when selecting the `Deploy Terraform?` option:

If you have customizations within these resources and do not want to overwrite any changes, uncheck the `Deploy Terraform?` input box.

Unchecking this means features mentioned in the resource descriptions above will need manual setup, which can be found in the respective feature's documentation.

7. Run the workflow.
   - This will deploy the assets to your environment with the default features enabled. See [Feature library Information](/feature-library/overview) for further details of whats enabled by default.
   - Environment properties will be automatically populated based on the deployed Flex configuration, including service and workflow SIDs. See [this page](/building/template-utilities/configuration#influencing-the-automatic-configuration) for information on how to influence this configuration.
 

All done! Once the workflow successfully completes, the template has been installed.
